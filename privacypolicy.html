        <h1>Privacy Policy for Colour Falls</h1>
        <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 28th October 2024</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to Colour Falls. This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your personal
            information when you use our game. We are committed to safeguarding your privacy and ensuring that your
            personal information is handled responsibly.
        </p>
        <p>
            By playing Colour Falls, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We do not directly collect personal information. However, the following information may be collected and used
            by third-party services integrated into the game:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google AdMob:</strong> We use Google AdMob to serve ads in Colour Falls. AdMob may collect
                certain information about your device, such as your device ID, IP address, and information about your
                interactions with ads. For more information, please refer to <a
                    href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google’s Privacy Policy</a>.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Locally Stored Data (Leaderboard Scores):</strong> Colour Falls stores your high scores locally
                on your device using UserDefaults. This data is not sent to any server or shared with third parties. The
                game saves up to the top 5 highest scores you achieve, and this information is stored solely for your
                personal use.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Score Sharing:</strong> Colour Falls allows you to share your score using a share sheet. When
                you choose to share your score, the text containing your score is generated, and you may select an app
                (such as social media or messaging) to share it. When you share your score, the app or service you use
                may collect information in accordance with its own privacy policy. We recommend reviewing the privacy
                policies of any third-party apps you use to share scores.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>The game may use data collected by Google AdMob to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Serve relevant advertisements to users.</li>
            <li>Improve the performance of ads within the game.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Leaderboard scores are stored locally on your device and are used solely for the purpose of displaying your
            high scores in the game.</p>

        <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>Colour Falls uses the following third-party services that may collect data in accordance with their own
            privacy policies:</p>

            <li>When you share your score using social media or messaging apps, those services have their own privacy
                policies that govern the data they collect. Please review their policies for more details.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>

            <strong>Leaderboard Scores:</strong> The leaderboard scores are stored locally on your device and are not
            shared with any external parties. You may delete the game or clear the app’s data to remove your scores from
            your device.
